# Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer n.
# Using a for loop and range(), print all positive integers greater than 0 and smaller than n.
#
# Sample output:
# Upper limit: 5
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# Write your code here:
n = int(input("Type in a positive integer n : "))

for x in range (1, n):
    print (x)
